$me is the program that generates the CPAN Dashboard web site.

This process is carried out in two stages.

  * gather - will gather all of the information about the CPAN modules
    that the site is configured to know about
  * build - will take the data gathered in the first stage and turn it
    into a web site

Usually, you want to run both stages - so that's what happens if you
don't give it any command-line options.
